<h1 class="top"> power dog 
</h1>

<p>In discussing the hardware inside a pc case,
we first identified the
<span class="definedTerm"> power supply </span>.
It serves to convert wall power to the lower-voltage power required
by the CPU, secondary storage units, and other components of the pc.
<a href="https://computer.howstuffworks.com/power-supply.htm">HowStuffWorks explains</a>
this well.
</p>

<p>
But power supplies have costs in money, weight, heat, and complication.
They fail more often than other components in a pc
(which is why it can be worth replacing a failed power supply).
Thinkers ask why engineers don't wire wall power directly to the CPU, 
secondary storage units, etc.
Sadly, students report that middle-school science teachers 
short-changed their intuition by omitting the classic demonstration of the 
potential of wall power: plugging a hot dog into the wall.</p>

<p>
Not to worry. We at StuyCS have what it takes to cut the mustard.
We also have kraut, bread, and a clamp-on ammeter.
</p>

<p>
The point of plugging a hot dog into the wall is to
demonstrate that heat is generated by electricity 
flowing through anything that resists that flow.
Here's the story science teachers tell about
what they expect to happen:
</p>

<ul>
<li> A little electricity flows. </li>
<li> The flow generates heat, warming the hot dog. </li>
<li> Warm hot dogs conduct electricity better than cold ones. </li>
<li> So more electricity flows&hellip; </li>
<li> which heats the hot dog more&hellip; </li>
<li> eventually resulting in a&hellip; Hot. Dog. </li>
</ul>

<p>
Believing teachers is not science, however.
Science means comparing stories to experience.
Here's what happened in one trial:

<h2>thanks and caveats</h2>
<p>
Ariel Kahan contributed ideas and photography skillz to this page.
Plus, he cooked the rest of the hot dogs the right way: fire.
</p>

<p>Do you need to be told "Don't try this at home unless you know what 
you're doing", or is that obvious?
Do you have a clamp-on ammeter, like the one pictured?
Do you want to wind up looking like the guy in the pictures?
You can't be too careful.
