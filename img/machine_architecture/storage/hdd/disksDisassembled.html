For people who have handled the separate parts of a hard disk drive, 
this picture shows how the separation was accomplished. A single-platter 
drive takes up the bottom third of the picture. Two identical 
two-platter drives are above it. The tools on the left helped, when 
wielded with skill and patience. Zoom in your browser to see details.

This is some nice work by Ariel Kahan. For example, see those sets of 
screws on the left side of the picture? The upper set for each disk is 
in the pattern in which Ariel removed the cover from the disk, and the 
lower pattern reflects taking out the platters.
